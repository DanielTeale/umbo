    Allied health services such as speech and occupational therapy enable people to participate in society better - 
through access to education, employment and social interactions. In rural and remote Australia, children in need are often unable to these services.

Enter Umbo.

Umbo matches a clinician in city to a family in the bush to deliver therapy through an online platform.

We support children to access vital therapy regardless of where they live, whilst also giving therapists the option of working from home - 
whenever they like, for as many or as few hours as they like. Families who have NDIS funding are able to use this funding to connect with an Umbo therapist.

We do it through an integrated solution which combines video calling, record keeping and goal setting, 
the ability to transfer files and share therapy resources, and track progress through gamification
